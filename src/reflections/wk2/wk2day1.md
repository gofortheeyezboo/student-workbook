What is Scope ?

Scope when it comes to variables determines where they can be used. If it is created inside a function it will only be available inside that function.

What is Hoisting ?

var are moved to the top of their scope and initialized with a value of undefined

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

const would be for a value that i know isnt going to change eg gravity = 9.8 m/s^2. I'd use var if I had some particular use for the hoisting mechanic.
