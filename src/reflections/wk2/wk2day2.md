What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

function name(parameters)
let name = function(parameters)
let name = (parameters) =>

the arrow function doesnt create its own this value and the function expression isnt hoisted

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used when defining a function arguments are passed into the function when it's called

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

higher order functions are ones that either take in or return another function. I haven't used these yet except for the prebuilt ones
