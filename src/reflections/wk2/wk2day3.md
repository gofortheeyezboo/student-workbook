What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

console.log seems to be the most useful but errors are also printed to console in red. its useful so you can immediately identify errors

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The 'Elements' Tab. It can be useful because you can do everything in one window.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

add debugger to a particular line where you would like to stop and analyze the code then open the debugger in dev tools
