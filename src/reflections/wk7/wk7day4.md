Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We used partner programming. We also thought about the user experience when designing our project.

What went well?

Everything went really well but my partner and I know each other well and had no roadblocks besides problems we didnt know how to solve in our code.

What would you do differently?

Plan more. When doing front end i think the more planning you do the easier it is to implement
