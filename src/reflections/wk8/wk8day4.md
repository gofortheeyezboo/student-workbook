What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Component testing - kind of like a unit test i suppose
End to End testing - Testing the whole app front to back allows you to experience the app from the users perspective
Unit test - testing individual units of code allows you to make sure your code is functional at the smallest level

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I like end to end because it feels rewarding when everything is running end to end.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

Component testing. If you are unit testing component testing seems unecessary to me
