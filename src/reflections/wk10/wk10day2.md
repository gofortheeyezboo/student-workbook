What is a List in C#?

It is a collection of like data types

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I think contains and add would be two useful methods to use often. To add items to a collection and to check if an element exists in a collection.

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I would use contains to check if the list contains the item.
