In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Rows store a complete object while columns store a specific property of that object.

Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.

CREATE TABLE characters(
  name VARCHAR(255),
  age VARCHAR(255),
  description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  id int
);

What is the difference between the following statements:

DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Delete gets rid of what is stored in the table. Drop table gets rid of the table.
