What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, reference type, pointer type. They differ based on how they store their value in memory.

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint

The strict typing each variables type has to be declared no more pojos 

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types store an address where the value is being stored. Value types don't store an address they store the actual value in memory.
